    <h3> 
      Keep in mind the following:
    </h3> 
      <p> 
        The topic of a talk can come from a broad spectrum.
        Any interesting theme from Java in particular and software development in general is welcome, from surveys to experience reports or specialized research topics.
        However, keep in mind that a talks should be able to attract a reasonable number of participants (80-500 participants).
      </p> 
      <p> 
        Experience has shown that talks on a very basic level, especially introductions to main-stream techniques as well product-oriented presentations are of less interest to the JavaZone attendees.
        Surveys, lessons learned and advanced topics (including advanced topics on programming techniques) are often much more successful.
        JavaZone participants are usually quite experienced in Java and Object Oriented development and come to a talk in order to get insight into some new area.
      </p> 
      <p> 
        The earlier a proposal arrives, the better the chances to get feedback in order to bring the proposal into a form that is likely to be accepted.

    <h3> 
      Tips on Slides and notes:
    </h3> 
    <ul> 
      <li> 
        The slide deck must be submitted by August 18th.
      </li> 
      <li> 
        Here are a few guidelines for preparing the slides
      </li> 
      <li> 
        Use at least a 14&nbsp;pt (or better an 18&nbsp;pt) font on all of your slides.
      </li> 
      <li> 
        A good slide should not just repeat everything you say but summarize your presentation.
      </li> 
      <li> 
        Use short phrases and keywords instead of full sentences.
      </li> 
      <li> 
        People cannot read as fast as you speak. Make heavy use of pictures and examples.
      </li> 
      <li> 
        Don't put too much or too little material on a single slide.
      </li> 
      <li> 
        A good rule of thumb is to spend 3 minutes per slide.
      </li> 
      <li> 
        You will have to provide the session slides to the programme committee for publication on the JavaZone website (see the deadline below).
      </li> 
      <li> 
        Try to achieve good printing quality.
      </li> 
      <li> 
        We may add a uniform cover page to all tutorial notes.
      </li> 
    </ul> 
     
    <h3> 
      Tips on Presentation:
    </h3> 
    <ul> 
      <li> 
        The participants expect that your presentation will be much easier to understand than a book about the same subject.
      </li> 
      <li> 
        Speak clearly and lively. Try to interact with your audience. (Remember that Norwegian participants need a longer warm-up time than an American audience)
      </li> 
      <li> 
        A presentation is much more lively if it also includes examples and demonstrations.
      </li> 
    </ul>
